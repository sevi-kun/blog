Hey, my name is Béla (Severin) Richartz. I build this Webpage using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and the [Zzo theme](https://github.com/zzossig/hugo-theme-zzo). My goal with this webpage is to share my knowledge and experience. English isn't my first language, so there may be some typos. I will try my best to make this Webpage a nice experience for you and for me. :)
